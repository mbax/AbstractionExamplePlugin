= Example Abstraction Plugin (with Maven!)

**MORE INFORMATION HERE** http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/115810/

=== Necessary to add support for a new version (example: v1_7_R1)

1) Create new folder for new module

2) Create new pom.xml for that folder (base it on existing implementation module poms)

3) Implement the interface at org.kitteh.example.plugin.nms.v1_7_R1.NMSHandler

4) Add reference in parent pom.xml

5) Add dependency in Plugin/pom.xml

6) Build!

You may use any of this in your own plugin. I would prefer that you give me some form of credit but that is not necessary.

I'm just happy to contribute toward better compatibility in plugins.
